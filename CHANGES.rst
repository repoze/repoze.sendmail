----------------

- Drop support for Python 3.3.

----------------

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

- Add support for Python 3.4 and 3.5.

- Add ``ignore_transient`` parameter to ``QueueProcessor``, to prevent raising
  temporary errors in some situations.  (PR #37)

4.2 (2014-02-17)
----------------

- Add "savepoint" support to transactional mail integration. (PR #24/28)

- Mail Delivery utilities can now be passed a transaction manager (falling
  back to the ''transaction.get()`` default), making it easier to override.
  (PR #27)

4.1 (2013-06-26)
----------------

- Replace 'utf_8' encoding name with preferred spelling ('utf-8').

- Replace 'latin_1' encoding name with preferred spelling ('iso-8859-1')

- Include the time of the error when logging errors from the queue processor.

- response.MIMEPart now correctly sets the charset of the email payload if it's
  one of the content_type parameters of the Message or Attachment.

- The SMTPMailer now accepts an "ssl" argument, which, if passed, will cause
  the SMTP factory to return an SMTP_SSL connection instead of a plain old
  SMTP connection.

- The SMTPMailer now uses a 10-second timeout by default, used when an
  SMTP connection is made but the server does not respond in enough time.

4.0 (2013-04-23)
----------------

- Add support for bulding docs and testing doctest snippets under ``tox``.

- Add ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs Sphinx).

- Converted docs to Sphinx.

4.0b2 (2013-03-28)
------------------

- Issue #13: fixed handling of headers with with multibyte unicode
  characters at the point where the header is split into multiple
  lines.

- Pull #15 - Extended repoze.sendmail with configurable `/usr/sbin/sendmail`
  binary support

4.0b1 (2013-01-09)
------------------

- Dropped support for Jython until a Jython-2.7-compatible version of
  ``zope.interface`` becomes available.

- Dropped support for Python 2.5.

- Added suupport for Python 3.3.

- Improved test for SSL feature under Python 3.x.

- Added new tests for proper encoding of binary attachments.

- Cauterized resource leak warnings under Python 3.2.

3.2 (2012-05-03)
----------------

- Issue #7:  fixed handling of to/from addresses with non-ascii
  characters when using queued mail delivery.

- Suppressed duplicate usage message output from ``qp``.

3.1 (2012-03-26)
----------------

- Fixed ``qp`` queue processor mail delivery under Python 3.0.

- Added 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).

3.0 (2012-03-20)
----------------

- Fixed `Message-Id` handling (see http://bugs.repoze.org/issue177).

- Provided improved support for encoding messages to bytes.  It should now be
  possible to represent your messages in `email.message.Message` objects just
  with unicode (excepting bytes for binary attachments) and the mailer will
  handler it as appropriate.

- Added tests for cPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, jython 2.5 and pypy 1.8
  compatibility.

2.3 (2011-05-17)
----------------

- Queued delivery now creates a copy of the passed in messsage before adding
  the 'X-Actually-{To,From}' headers. This avoids rudely mutating the message
  being sent in ways that might not be expected by the sender. (LP #780000)

2.2 (2010-09-14)
----------------

- Made debug output for SMTP mailer optional.  (Thanks to Igor Stroh for
  patch.)

2.1 (2010-07-28)
----------------

- Silently ignore redundant calls to abort transaction. (LP #580164)

2.0 (2010-03-10)
----------------

Represents major refactoring with a number of backwards incompatible changes.
The focus of the changes is on simplifying and updating the internals,
removing usage of deprecated APIs, removing unused functionality and using the
`email` module from the standard library wherever possible. A few changes have
been made solely to reduce internal complexity.

- Public facing APIs no longer accept messages passed as strings.  Messages
  must be instances of email.message.Message.

- Deprecated APIs have been replaced with newer 'email' module throughout.

- Functions that return message ids no longer strip containing less than and
  greater than characters.

- Events were removed entirely.  There was nothing in the code actually
  performing a notify anyway.  Removes dependency on zope.event.

- Normalized directory structure.  (Got rid of 'src' directory.)

- Got rid of functions to send queued mail from a thread or a daemon process.
  These are more appropriately handled in the calling code.

- Removed vocabulary.  It was a fossil from its days as zope.sendmail and was
  not used by anything.

- Got rid of the zcml directives.  These were written in such a way that you
  would end up putting deployment configuration in your zcml, which is a
  fundamentally broken pattern.  Users of the ZCA may still register utilities
  aginst the IMailDelivery and IMailer interfaces.  This is the recommended way
  to use repoze.sendmail with the Zope Component Architecture.

- Removed all interfaces that did not correspond to a rational plug point.
  This leaves only IMailDelivery and IMailer.

- Removed dependency on zope.i18nmessageid

- No longer works under Python 2.4 (Python 2.5 required).

1.2 (2010-02-11)
----------------

- Maildir storage for queue can now handle unicode passed in for message or
  to/from addresses.

1.1 (2009-02-24)
----------------

- Added logging to queue processor console app.

- Added ini config parsing to queue processor console app.

1.0 (2009-02-24)
----------------

- Initial release

- Copy of zope.sendmail with dependency on security removed.
